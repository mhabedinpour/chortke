# Chortke (چرتکه)

Work in progress. This repository is my learning playground as I get better at Rust.

Goal: build a fully working matching engine in Rust, powered by Raft for replication and fault tolerance.

About the name: Chortke (چرتکه) means "Abacus" in Farsi/Persian.

### Status
- WIP: interfaces, data structures, and architecture are evolving.
- Expect breaking changes until the first tagged release.

### Vision
- Core limit-order-book and matching logic
- Deterministic, replayable event stream
- Raft-based consensus for durability and high availability
- Clear separation between engine, networking, and storage layers

### Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas, fixes, or questions:
- Open an issue to discuss
- Submit a PR with a focused change
- Be kind and include tests when possible

### License
TBD while the project is in early development; will be formalized before the first stable release.
